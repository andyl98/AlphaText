      "article = (CNN) -- Football legend Diego Maradona had his earrings seized by Italian authorities Friday to help pay off his back taxes, according to media reports. Diego Maradona sports expensive-looking earrings during a recent football match. The current coach of Argentina's national team was staying at a clinic in northern Italy in a bid to lose weight when finance police swooped, Reuters.com reported. The jewelry was said to be worth €4,000 ($5,888). Italian tax authorities say he owes the country €31 million ($45 million) in back taxes from when he played for top league club Napoli between 1984 and 1991. But Maradona says the Serie A club should have paid the taxes. Three years ago, tax police took two Rolex watches from him when he was back in Italy for a benefit match. The 48-year old is under intense pressure in his native Argentina after a dismal World Cup qualifying campaign left his star-studded team in danger of missing their first tournament since 1970. After a recent defeat against Paraguay he was quoted by FIFA.com as saying, \"I am not afraid of criticism. I am afraid of nobody. I am doing my job, I have my team and I am going to go forward. \"I have been battling critics since I was 15 years old. Now I am 48 and I am going to continue to battle with them [the press].\" ...\n",

      "article = DIR VALLEY, Pakistan (CNN) -- The rugged beauty of the expansive Dir Valley can mask the detail of what is happening on the ground. Pakistani soldiers look on from a mountain during a patrol in the troubled area of Maidan. In June, the Pakistani military organized a media tour to areas of the Lower Dir in North West Frontier Province that were under their control. The town of Maidan had been at the center of fierce fighting between Pakistan's military forces and militants. Tension was visible on the faces of those escorting us. The IED (improvised explosive device) craters in the road and the bullet holes in our unarmed pickup trucks explained why. The direct fighting had stopped some days before, after opposition forces were reported killed or they disappeared into the surrounding hills and among the population. Under the watchful eye of government forces, anxious local residents were starting to return. A Pakistani army spokesperson now tells us that all of those who fled the town due to the fighting have returned home. They have a lot of rebuilding to do. Most of the structures we saw had some kind of damage to them from bullets or direct hits from artillery fire. One person who will likely not be returning anytime soon is the pro-Taliban cleric Sufi Muhammad, who brokered a short-lived deal between the Taliban and the government that allowed the Taliban to enforce Sharia law in the Swat Valley. But the deal collapsed and the government set off this offensive. Sufi Muhammad was arrested in Peshawar in late July, accused of encouraging violence. His ransacked house was the last stop on our tour. ...\n",

      "article = (CNN) -- British police Wednesday arrested 12 people in a counterterrorism operation, and locations were being searched, authorities said. A Scotland Yard official's papers show details of the raid, which have been obscured in this photo. Arrests were carried out in a series of raids in northwest England, police said. Participating agencies included Merseyside Police, Greater Manchester Police and the Lancashire Constabulary, according to a statement from Greater Manchester Police. The men arrested were involved in a \"very serious\" plot closely associated with al Qaeda and escaped al Qaeda operative Rashid Rauf, whom British intelligence have linked to the 2006 plot to blow up trans-Atlantic airliners, according to a security source with knowledge of the investigation. The new plot was not believed to be targeting national infrastructure, such as rail lines, airports or utilities, nor was it clear if the plot was to involved bombs or an assault involving gunmen, the source said. Details, the source said, were speculative at this point in the investigation. The source also said authorities don't believe the targets would have been in the north of England, where the arrests took place, and that at least some of those arrested were Pakistanis in the United Kingdom on student visas. Several hundred officers were involved in the raids, according to a later Greater Manchester Police statement. The men arrested range in age from a youth in his mid- to late teens to a 41-year-old, the statement said. No further information was available, police said. \"Today's action is part of an ongoing investigation and we have acted on intelligence received,\" said Steve Ashley, chief superintendent of Merseyside police. \"We understand that this kind of police activity can cause concerns to people living in nearby communities. The extra patrols, cordons and measures we have in place have been implemented to make sure we are doing everything we can to reassure the public and maintain public safety.\" Home Secretary Jacqui Smith, in a written statement, congratulated police for the \"successful anti-terrorism operation which has resulted in 12 arrests at a number of locations.\" She said the actions were an operational decision by police and Security Services, but she and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown were kept apprised. Police rushed to make the arrests after press photographers on Tuesday snapped images of the U.K.'s chief terrorism officer as he got out of a car at the prime minister's residence, according to the security source. Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Bob Quick was carrying a document containing the names of those to be arrested, the source said, and the photographers were able to easily read the names when they enlarged the photographs. But, the source said, the arrests would probably have taken place Thursday, and preparations for the arrests were the reason for Quick's visit to see Brown. \"Tonight, the focus is the ongoing operation. That's my priority,\" Smith said. Scotland Yard issued a statement regarding the incident. \"Quick accepts he made a mistake on leaving a sensitive document on open view and deeply regrets it. He has apologized to the commissioner and the colleagues.\" CNN's Andrew Carey and Laura Perez-Maestro contributed to this report. ...\n",

      "article = CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN) -- Authorities arrested a man accused of secretly taping ESPN sports reporter Erin Andrews in the nude and posting the videos on the Internet, the FBI said Friday. ESPN reporter Erin Andrews claims someone videotaped her while she was nude and posted video online. Authorities arrested 48-year-old Michael David Barrett at Chicago O'Hare International Airport on Friday. Barrett faces a charge of interstate stalking, the FBI said. Barrett is accused of taping Andrews while she was nude in two hotel rooms. He then made eight videos that he posted on the Internet, the FBI said. Barrett allegedly filmed seven of the eight videos at a hotel room in Nashville, Tennessee, in September 2008. FBI agents said they found evidence that a peephole to the door of Andrews' hotel room had been altered. The FBI learned that Barrett checked into the same hotel at that time and asked for a room adjacent to Andrews using his home address to register for the room. According to a criminal complaint, Barrett tried to sell the videos to celebrity gossip Web site TMZ.com. Employees at the Web site also helped in the investigation providing Barrett's information to Andrews' attorney. Andrews works as a sideline reporter traveling around the country covering college football games. Barrett will have his first court appearance in Chicago at 10 a.m. (11 a.m. ET) Saturday, authorities said. The maximum penalty for the charge of interstate stalking is five years in federal prison, the FBI said. CNN's Greg Morrison contributed to this report. ...\n",

      "article = (CNN) -- The defense attorney appointed to represent an Alabama professor accused of shooting her colleagues said Friday he regrets describing her as \"wacko.\" But at a news conference, Roy Miller said \"something's wrong with this lady.\" He also said his client, Amy Bishop, is \"aware of what she's done and she's very sorry for it.\" Bishop is under suicide watch in jail, Miller said. In an interview Thursday with CNN affiliate WHNT after visiting Bishop, Miller said, \"I just think the case speaks for itself.\" He added, \"I think she's wacko.\" At Friday's news conference, he referred to that remark. \"Good lord, y'all,\" Miller said. \"Listen, I went overboard with that. When I talk to y'all I make statements ... I wish I hadn't have made. And probably that's one of them.\" He added that he was trying to imply that the facts of the case \"speak for themselves.\" Bishop told him she does not remember the incident, Miller said. But now, \"she knows she's killed some folks, I'm sure.\" The biology professor is charged with capital murder and three counts of attempted murder in the shootings at the University of Alabama in Huntsville last week. At the end of a biology department faculty meeting at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, Bishop suddenly \"just stood up and shot,\" a professor who survived the incident told CNN affiliate WAAY. Three of Bishop's colleagues were killed; three others were wounded. Bishop, a Harvard-trained geneticist, had recently been denied tenure. Bishop, a professor and researcher at the university, was arrested as she was leaving the building. A 9 mm handgun was found inside, on the second floor. A university spokesman, Ray Garner, identified the dead as Gopi Podila, chairman of the biological sciences department; Maria Davis, associate professor of biology; and Adriel Johnson, associate professor of biology. Miller said his client is \"trying to keep from cracking up down there emotionally,\" and is worried that if she breaks down, officials in the jail might think she's going to commit suicide. Discussing his client's mind, he said that doctors of biology \"have got, in my estimation, high IQs -- and the high IQ in my opinion is sometimes not good for people.\" He said Bishop sometimes is \"so focused on the mental basis\" that she \"does not know what's going on around her.\" He said he believes the case will boil down to Bishop's mental state at the time of the killings. In the wake of the shootings, information came to light about previous run-ins with the law Bishop had. She faced criminal charges after an altercation at a Massachusetts restaurant nearly eight years ago, police said. The police report says Bishop became furious that there was no booster seat available for her child, began screaming at the woman who had taken the last one and struck her in the head. Authorities previously have said Bishop, who is also known as Amy Bishop Anderson, fatally shot her brother in the family's Braintree, Massachusetts, home in 1986. The shooting was ruled accidental, but after a review of the incident after the Alabama shootings, Norfolk County District Attorney William Keating issued a statement saying that probable cause had existed in 1986 to charge Bishop with assault with a dangerous weapon, carrying a dangerous weapon and unlawful possession of ammunition. However, the statute of limitations on those charges has expired, as well as on a potential charge of \"wanton and reckless conduct\" -- the lowest standard for manslaughter in Massachusetts, Keating said. In addition, the Boston Globe reported Monday that Bishop and her husband, Jim Anderson, were questioned in the 1993 attempted mail bombing of a Harvard Medical School professor. Jim Anderson said on Monday that federal investigators had gathered \"a dozen subjects\" in the attempted bombing, but \"there were never any suspects. Never anyone charged, never anyone arrested. Then five years later, we got a letter from the ATF saying, 'You are in the clear.' \" ...\n",
